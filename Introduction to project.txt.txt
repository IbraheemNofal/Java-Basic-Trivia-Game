An old project of mine which I did for a component programming course back in second year, and later edited slightly for a Networks course.
Back in my Component programming course, we'd been already taught how to create SQL connections and query in Java, but I decided that I 
should also learn how to program sockets. Not my finest work, but still serves as a good reference for learning socket programming and SQL connections
in Java. In simple terms, there's a server and a client, the server waits for the client to connect, retrieves questions from the DB and sends them to
client, which presents them for the user and returns the answer to the server. Simple and easy.
